# Sports Facility Booking Application

Project live link:

It's a Node.js application built with Node.js, Express.js and TypeScript.


## Set up application

First of all you need to clone the repository. Here is the repository link:
https://github.com/Mehedi556/sports-facility-booking

In the command prompt you have to write this command. The full command is ( git clone https://github.com/Mehedi556/sports-facility-booking.git )

Then go to the downloaded repository by cd (repository name) or manually.

Secondly install all the dependencies by write in the terminal

    npm install 




To run the application in development mode, use the following command: 

    npm run start:dev




This will start the server using ts-node-dev, which will automatically restart the server when code changes are detected.

To run the application in production mode, you need to build the project first and then start the server: 

    npm run build 

for build.


    npm run start:prod 


for start the server.
